This is a small personal project that allows for batch encoding of video files using the FFMPEG command line tool.

Multiple directories can be specified in the command line arguments for the code and the FFMPEG command will attempt to run on every file in the specified directory and all sub-directories. Failures are logged to the console and printed to a text file for troubleshooting.
